so O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes S-MISC

uncertain O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths S-MISC
, O
and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth S-MISC

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O

is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O

Marca E-PER
( O
16th O
century O

, O
in O
his O
Histoire B-MISC
de M-MISC
Beam E-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths S-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots S-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens S-MISC

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses S-MISC

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians S-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O

and O
that O
, O
Goths S-MISC

these O

the O
Middle O

with O
a O
particular O
form O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O

It O

The O

on O
two O

systems O
in O

lifetime O
: O
the O

system O

where O
a O

would O
face O
a O

challenger O
each O
week O
for O
the O
championship O
, O
and O
the O
series O
system O
, O
which O
corresponds O
to O
the O
regular O
season O
found O
in O
the O
NHL S-ORG
today O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
1888 O
, O
the O
challenge O
system O
was O
exclusively O
used O
in O
the O
AHAC S-ORG
before O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
Stanley B-MISC
Cup E-MISC
, O
while O
the O
series O
system O
became O
the O
norm O
in O
1893 O
, O
the O
first O
year O
the O
Cup S-MISC
was O
contested O
. O

The O
first O
championship O
team O
of O
the O
AHAC S-ORG
was O
the O
Montreal B-ORG

having O
unofficially O
being O
declared O
the O
champions O
before O
the O
AHAC S-ORG

The O
first O
title O

occurred O
on O

, O
1887 O
, O
when O
the O
Montreal B-ORG
Victorias E-ORG
defeated O
the O
champions O
4-0 O
. O

The O
Victorias S-ORG
would O
hold O
the O
title O
until O
the O
very O
last O
challenge O
game O
, O
when O
the O
Crystals S-ORG
won O
3-2 O
in O
their O
third O
successive O
challenge O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
Vics S-ORG
' O
long O
run O
as O
champions O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
switch O
to O
the O
series O
system O
in O
1888 O
. O

The O
series O
system O
was O
a O
success O
, O
although O
a O
tie O
atop O
the O
standings O
between O
the O
Vics S-ORG

the O
Montreal B-ORG
Hockey M-ORG
Club E-ORG
( O
Montreal B-ORG

, O
and O
the O
subsequent O
scheduling O
of O
the O
tiebreaker O
game O
caused O
much O
trouble O
when O
the O
game O
was O
scheduled O
at O

time O

were O
injured O
, O
at O
the O
home O

the O
Montreal B-ORG

However O
, O
teams O
from O

incurred O
huge O
travelling O
expenses O
, O
which O
led O
the O
AHAC S-ORG
to O
revert O
back O
to O
the O
challenge O
system O
. O

In O
1893 O
, O
the O
first O
year O
since O

played O
under O

for O
the O

15 O

parent O

the O
Montreal B-ORG
Amateur M-ORG
Athletic M-ORG
Association E-ORG
( O
MAAA S-ORG

. O

The O
hockey O
club O
was O
adamant O
about O
refusing O
the O
trophy O
, O
while O
the O
directors O
of O
the O
MAAA S-ORG
decided O
to O
accept O
the O
trophy O
, O
considering O
it O
came O
from O
the O
Governor O
General O
of O
Canada S-LOC
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
trophy O
was O
accepted O
by O
the O
MAAA S-ORG
, O
but O
with O
none O
of O
the O
hockey O
officials O
of O
the O

present O
. O

After O
accepting O
the O
trophy O
, O
the O
hockey O
club O
remained O
adamant O
about O
returning O
the O
trophy O
that O
was O
presented O
to O
them O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
MAAA S-ORG
investigated O
into O
why O
its O
hockey O
club O
wanted O
to O
refuse O
and O
return O
the O
trophy O
, O
even O
though O
such O
an O
action O
would O
damage O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
MAAA S-ORG
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
the O
people O
who O
were O
in O
charge O
of O
running O
their O
team O
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
not O
representative O
of O
the O
team O
itself O
, O
and O
when O
the O
hockey O
club O
asked O
for O
a O
loan O
of O
$175 O
in O
start-up O
expenses O
for O
the O
1894 O
season O
, O
it O
was O
flatly O
refused O
( O
the O
first O
time O
the O
MAAA S-ORG
refused O
anything O
to O
the O
hockey O
club O
) O
. O

Inexplicably O
, O
the O
hockey O
club O
reversed O
its O
position O
, O
and O
the O
next O
few O
months O
saw O
a O
gradual O
schism O
between O
the O
MAAA S-ORG
and O
the O
club O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
inscriptions O
on O
the O
Cup S-MISC
when O
it O
was O
successfully O
defended O
in O
1894 O
only O
stated O
" O
Montreal B-ORG

" O
. O

The O
MAAA S-ORG
, O
at O
one O
point O
, O
considered O
the O
hockey O
club O
to O
have O
seceded O
from O
the O
organization O
that O
bore O
them O
. O

The O
issue O
would O
be O
finally O
resolved O
in O
later O
years O
, O
after O
various O
attempts O
at O
reconciliation O

1987 O
, O
was O
forced O
to O

a O
life-threatening O
Caesarean O

in O
an O
unsuccessful O
attempt O

case O
law O
establishing O
the O
rights O
of O
pregnant O
women O
to O
determine O
their O
own O
health O
care O
. O

At O
age O
thirteen O
, O
Angela B-PER
Stoner E-PER
was O
diagnosed O
with O
a O
rare O
and O
usually O
fatal O
form O
of O
cancer O
. O

She O
survived O
, O
and O
after O
years O
of O
chemotherapy O
and O
radiation O
therapy O
was O
declared O
to O
be O
in O
remission O
. O

Ten O
years O
after O
the O
initial O
diagnosis O
she O
developed O
another O
form O
of O
cancer O
, O
which O
she O
and O
her O
doctors O
fought O
with O
equal O
determination O
. O

The O
second O
cancer O
went O
into O
remission O
. O

Angela E-PER
later O
married O
and O
became O
pregnant O
. O

In O
1987 O
, O
when O
Carder S-PER
was O
twenty-five O
weeks O
pregnant O
, O
her O
cancer O
was O
discovered O
to O
have O
recurred O
and O
metastasized O
to O
her O
lung O
. O

Exactly O
what O
plan O
she O
made O
on O
learning O
this O
is O
unclear O
: O
one O
source O
claims O
that O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
prolong O
her O
life O
, O
and O
elected O
to O
start O
radiation O
and O
chemotherapy O
, O
regardless O
of O
known O
risks O
to O
the O
fetus O
; O
others O
state O
that O
she O
chose O
to O
institute O
only O
palliative O
care O
, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
remain O
alive O
until O
the O
28th O
week O
of O
gestation O
, O
when O
it O
was O
thought O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
a O
better O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

Whatever O
her O
choice O
, O
the O
administrators O
of O
George B-ORG
Washington M-ORG
University M-ORG
Hospital E-ORG
-- O
who O
were O
also O
the O
liability O
risk O
managers O
-- O
were O
disturbed O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
had O
not O
elected O
to O
have O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
procedure O
. O

Fearing O
a O
lawsuit O
by O
pro-life O
activists O
, O
they O
convened O
a O
court O
hearing O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
obtained O
separate O
counsels O
for O
Carder S-PER
, O
her O
fetus O
, O
and O
the O
hospital O
. O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder S-PER
's O
husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O
survive O
it O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
it O
( O
Carder S-PER
herself O
, O
now O
gravely O
ill O
, O
did O
not O
testify O
) O
. O

Her O
treating O
physicians O
also O
opposed O
the O
procedure O
. O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O
not O
personally O
familiar O
with O
her O
medical O
status O
testified O
that O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
healthy O
woman O
's O
fetus O
at O
the O
same O
gestational O
age O
. O

Carder E-PER
's O
own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
; O
he O
has O
since O
stated O
that O
he O
would O
have O
called O
the O
procedure O
" O
medically O
inadvisable O
both O
for O
Angela B-PER
Carder E-PER
and O
for O
the O
fetus O
" O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
and O
despite O
medical O
testimony O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
probably O
end O
Carder S-PER
's O
life O
, O
an O
order O
was O
issued O
authorizing O
the O
hospital O
to O
perform O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
. O

Obstetricians O
at O
the O
hospital O
initially O
refused O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
procedure O
, O
but O
eventually O
one O
reluctantly O
agreed O
. O

A O
three-judge O
appellate O
panel O
upheld O
the O
decision O
in O
an O
emergency O
telephone O
appeal O
, O
despite O
Carder S-PER
's O
own O
repeated O
pleas O
of O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
done O
. O
" O

Exactly O
how O
long O
the O
fetus O
survived O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
some O
dispute O
. O

The O
most O
commonly O
cited O
figure O
is O
two O
hours O
. O

Susan M-PER
Faludi E-PER
quotes O
the O
obstetrician O
who O
performed O
the O
surgery O
as O
saying O
attempts O
to O
inflate O
the O
fetus O
's O
lungs O
were O
" O
like O
trying O
to O

themselves O
in O

and O
almost O
impenetrable O
bush O
where O
the O
Azna S-MISC
defended O
themselves O
when O
facing O
a O
superior O
enemy O

After O
the O
Azna S-MISC
had O
started O
to O
sisperse O
under O
the O
French S-MISC
gunfire O

their O
lines O
broke O
when O
hit O
by O
three O
grapeshot O
balls O

the O
Azna S-MISC
then O
retreated O
in O
the O
bush O
, O
where O
the O
thick O
foliage O
partly O
protected O
the O
natives O
from O
the O

The O
French S-MISC
felt O
that O
if O
left O
there O
, O
the O
Azna S-MISC
may O
attack O
them O
at O
night O

so O
it O
was O

to O
assault O
the O
bush O

but O
being O
careful O
to O
leave O
a O
way O
of O
escape O
for O
the O
Azna S-MISC
open O
, O
so O
to O
avoid O
a O
too O
deadly O
confrontation O
that O
could O
cost O
too O
much O
blood O
. O

The O
French S-MISC
met O
a O
strong O
resistance O
, O
killing O
2 O
riflemen O
and O
wounding O
4 O
, O
but O
were O
at O
the O
end O
successful O
and O
forced O
the O
Azna S-MISC

The O

the O
2,000 O

Both O

not O

enough O

Belgrano S-PER

confidently O
believing O
that O

not O
provide O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O

any O

between O
Belgrano S-PER

Castro E-PER
also O
attained O
documents O

With O
these O

Pazuela S-PER

interrupt O
Belgrano S-PER

began O
his O

of O
the O

forced O
them O

down O

champion O

Then O
, O
further O
controversy O
. O

In O
the O
hazy O
, O
backlit O
conditions O
of O
the O
late O
afternoon O
, O
it O
was O
revealed O
that O
the O
judges O
had O
confused O
the O
riders O
, O
awarding O
Player S-PER
the O
points O
for O
a O
ride O
his O
opponent O
had O
made O
. O

Scores O
were O
hastily O
revised O
, O
then O
the O
gutting O
news O
: O
Player S-PER
had O
been O
relegated O
to O
runner-up O
, O
just O
moments O
before O
he O
was O
due O
to O
be O
presented O
with O
the O
Pipeline B-MISC
trophy E-MISC
. O

The O
confusion O
soured O
the O
occasion O
. O

But O
Ben B-PER
Player E-PER
was O
bodyboarding O
's O
newest O
world O
champion O
. O

This O
month O
Player S-PER
returns O
to O
Hawaii S-LOC
to O
defend O
his O
title O
. O

No O
such O
contest O
debacles O
this O
year O
, O
which O
means O
Ben B-PER
Player E-PER
is O
more O
ambitious O
than O
ever O
to O
win O
it O
clean O
. O

And O
again O
it O
will O
all O
come O
down O
to O
Pipeline S-MISC
, O
where O
his O
performances O
every O
winter O
since O
he O
first O
arrived O
as O
a O
wiry O
16-year-old O
have O
made O
him O
a O
stand O
out O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
surfcraft O
you O
favour O
, O
as O
even O
the O
greatest O
surfer O
on O
the O
planet O
will O
attest O
. O

" O
Ben S-PER
gets O
a O
fair O
share O
of O
respect O
from O
the O
crew O
there O
, O
" O
says O
Kelly B-PER
Slater E-PER
. O

" O
He O
does O
n't O
really O
say O
all O
that O
much O
but O
seems O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
right O
. O

He O
has O
a O
good O
eye O
for O
how O
to O
ride O
a O
wave O
. O

A O
great O
surfer O
is O
a O
great O
surfer O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
they O
ride O
. O
" O

That O
wiry O
frame O
has O
filled O
out O
during O
the O
13 O
seasons O
he O
's O
spent O
hassling O
for O
waves O
amongst O
the O
hungry O
pack O
of O
board O
riders O
who O
converge O
on O
the O
famous O
stretch O
of O
sand O
every O
northern O
winter O
. O

He O
shares O
physical O
traits O
with O
his O
brother O
Toby S-PER
, O
also O
a O
pro O
bodyboarder O
and O
half O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
name O
Player S-PER
has O
been O
tattooed O
on O
everything O
bodyboarding O
since O
the O
sport O
's O
boom O
days O
of O
the O
mid-1990s O
. O

" O
You O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
be O
competitive O
with O
your O
brother O
, O
" O
Ben S-PER
says O
of O
their O
early O
years O
riding O
the O
wedging O
peaks O
of O
Whale B-LOC
Beach E-LOC
, O
on O
Sydney S-LOC
's O
northern O
beaches O
. O

As O
the O
younger O
sibling O
, O
Ben S-PER
was O
constantly O
surfing O
with O
guys O
his O
senior O
, O
something O
he O
feels O
refined O
his O
talent O
and O
drive O
. O

" O
The O
fact O
Toby S-PER
was O
more O
popular O
than O
me O
just O
made O
me O
even O
more O
competitive O
. O
" O

In O
fact O
Ben B-PER
Player E-PER
's O
biography O
reflects O
the O
twists O
and O
turns O
of O
the O
phenomenal O
growth O
of O
this O
comparatively O
new O
sport O
. O

Player E-PER
won O
Australian S-MISC
titles O
as O
a O
cadet O
( O
under-16s O
) O
and O
as O
a O
pro O
in O
2000 O
, O
part O
of O
the O
new O
generation O
that O
reshaped O
bodyboarding O
in O
Australia S-LOC
. O

This O
crew O
put O
new O
emphasis O
on O
style O
and O
fluidity O
in O
big O
moves O
and O
heavy O
situations O
, O
keeping O
their O
bodies O
and O
legs O
tight O
and O
in O
control O
through O
monstrous O
airs O
, O
milking O
power O
out O
of O
the O
pocket O
of O
the O
wave O
-- O
the O
bowl O
that O
forms O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barrelling O
section O
. O

His O
progressive O
riding O
and O
surfer-good O
looks O
made O
him O
the O
complete O
package O
, O
but O
at O
24 O
, O
when O
he O
might O
have O
been O
cashing O
in O
, O
his O
seat O
at O
the O
head O
of O
bodyboarding O
's O
table O
was O
kicked O
out O
from O
under O
him O
. O

At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
new O
millennium O
, O
surf O
brands O
began O
pulling O
out O
of O
bodyboarding O
. O

" O
Three O
years O
ago O
I O
lost O
both O
sponsors O
on O
the O
same O
day O
. O

[ O
Surfwear O
label O
] O
Quiksilver S-ORG
totally O
pulled O
out O
of O
bodyboarding O
and O
the O
company O
distributing O
Morey S-ORG
boards O
went O
bankrupt O
, O
so O
of O
course O
my O
contract O
went O
bust O
. O

Basically O
I O
lost O
$85,000 O
for O
that O
year O
and O
$35,000 O
that O
was O
owed O
to O
me O
, O
" O
says O
Player S-PER
. O

Player E-PER
pinpoints O
Mike B-PER
Stewart E-PER
-- O
the O
undisputed O
guru O
of O
bodyboarding O
who O
had O
pioneered O
the O
sport O
-- O
for O
kick-starting O
an O
era O
of O
self-reliance O
and O
self-belief O
, O
backed O
by O
his O
call O
to O
" O
support O
those O
who O
support O
bodyboarding O
" O
. O

A O
kind O
of O
evangelistic O
patriotism O
swept O
through O
the O
sport O
. O

First O
came O
the O
launch O
of O
bodyboard-specific O
clothing O
brands O
, O
then O
wetsuits O
and O
accessories O
. O

Now O
bodyboarding O
specific O
stores O
have O
opened O
to O
cater O
for O
the O
newly O
independent O
industry O
. O

" O
The O
sport O
is O
in O
a O
much O
better O
position O
now O
, O
" O
Player S-PER
will O
tell O
you O
. O

" O
It O
's O
still O
growing O
, O
but O
with O
the O
money O
remaining O
in O
bodyboarding O
. O
" O

The O
thought O
of O
quitting O
never O
entered O
his O
head O
. O

" O
It O
was O
more O
a O
question O
of O
' O
How O
am O
I O
going O
to O
make O
ends O
meet O
? O
" O

He O
'd O
always O
harboured O
a O
creative O
streak O
, O
was O
an O
avid O
scribe O
within O
the O
sport O
and O
a O
self-taught O
graphic O
designer O
... O
The O
answer O
seems O
obvious O
now O
: O
Player S-PER
pooled O
the O
last O
of O
his O
savings O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
and O
launched O
a O
magazine O
. O

" O
The O
only O
other O
bodyboarding O
magazine O
on O
the O
market O
was O
aimed O
at O
a O
young O
teenage O
audience O
, O
and O
here O
I O
was O
20-something O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
relate O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
make O
something O
I O
could O
show O
people O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Hey O
, O
this O
is O
what O
I O
do O
. O
' O
" O

For O
the O
first O
two O
years O
Player S-PER
sold O
advertising O
for O
the O
mag O
, O
which O
was O
named O
Movement S-ORG
. O

It O
now O
employs O
four O
people O
( O
yes O
, O
including O
this O
author O
) O
. O

Player E-PER
's O
been O
able O
to O
step O
away O
from O
the O
day-to-day O
business O
, O
but O
the O
magazine O
is O
a O
venture O
that O
will O
keep O
him O
firmly O
rooted O
in O
the O
sport O
. O

It O
has O
even O
re-energised O
his O
passion O
for O
the O
sport O
. O

" O
The O
more O
I O
worked O
on O
Movement S-ORG
the O
more O
stoked O
I O
became O
on O
bodyboarding O
again O
. O
" O

As O
the O
street O
cred O
of O
bodyboarding O
evolved O
, O
so O
did O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
sport O
. O

Bodyboarders O
now O
seek O
out O
the O
sort O
of O
aquatic O
slabs O
breaking O
in O
shallow O
water O
that O
stand-up O
surfers O
leave O
alone O
. O

" O
On O
a O
bodyboard O
you O
can O
handle O
much O
steeper O
situations O
. O

Being O
prone O
means O
you O
can O
ride O
over O
very O
shallow O
, O
ledging O
reefs O
, O
sometimes O
just O
inches O
deep O
, O
where O
you O
wo O
n't O
get O
knocked O
off O
by O
steps O
in O
the O
wave O
. O
" O

This O
extreme O
element O
comes O
with O
heavy O
consequences O
. O

During O
a O
contest O
in O
Tahiti S-LOC
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
Player S-PER
pulled O
into O
a O
barrel O
that O
shut O
down O
on O
him O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
came O
up O
for O
air O
, O
he O
was O
bleeding O
from O
both O
ears O
from O
the O
sheer O
pressure O
exerted O
by O
the O
imploding O
wave O
. O

" O
I O
think O
surfing O
actually O
embraces O
bodyboarding O
much O
more O
now O
, O
because O
it O
's O
not O
really O
seen O
as O
competition O
-- O
we O
're O
something O
totally O
different O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

" O
We O
're O
surfing O
our O
own O
waves O
and O
we O
've O
got O
our O
own O
industry O
. O
" O

The O

it O
retains O
its O

to O

for O

, O
where O
he O
remained O
until O
his O

in O

Hitzig E-PER
is O
remembered O
for O
his O
work O
concerning O
the O
interaction O

electrical O
current O
and O
the O
brain O
. O

In O
1870 O
, O
Hitzig S-PER
assisted O
by O
anatomist O
Gustav B-PER
Fritsch E-PER
( O
1837-1927 O
) O
, O
applied O
electricity O
via O
a O
thin O
probe O
to O
the O
exposed O
cerebral O
cortex O
of O
a O
dog O
without O
anesthesia O
. O

They O
performed O
these O
studies O
at O
the O

Fritsch S-PER
because O
the O
University B-ORG
of M-ORG
Berlin E-ORG
would O
not O
allow O
such O
experimentation O
in O
their O
laboratories O
. O

What O
Hitzig S-PER
and O
Fritsch S-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contractions O
of O
specific O
parts O
of O
the O
dog O
's O
body O
. O

They O
identified O
the O
brains O

" O

strip O

which O
is O
a O
vertical O
strip O
of O
brain O
tissue O
on O
the O
cerebrum O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
which O
controls O
different O
muscles O
in O
the O
body O
. O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig S-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
an O
essay O
called O
" O
On B-MISC
the M-MISC
Electrical M-MISC
Excitability M-MISC
of M-MISC
the M-MISC
Cerebrum E-MISC
" O
. O
This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig S-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
brain O
and O
electricity O
; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
the O
Prussian B-ORG
Army E-ORG
he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O
by O
bullets O
. O

Hitzig E-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
movement O
. O

Apparently O
Hitzig S-PER

crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
18th O

However O
, O
